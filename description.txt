I used a bi-directional GRU and spacy. I'm currently only using a single layer with 128 nodes and max pooling. I will also probably switch to spacy's vectorizer before my final submission. I think the bigger problem with all of this is that "offense" is a deeply subjective state. And worse, if we're actually trying to get at things like hate group activity we need to recognize that "offense" is political and that not all offenses are created equally. Without extremely clear understandings around these things we get a bunch of very clearly offensive tweets in this gold-label being marked as NOT.
